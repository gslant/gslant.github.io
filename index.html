<h1>CTiS: The positive and negative impacts of AI surveilience on society</h1>


</ul><p>Artificial intellegence is very much still an emerging technology. In the future, we may be able to hold complex conversations
  with man-made AI, we may even put them in charge of the worlds biggest industries as they could use their immense intellegence to operate
  systems at 100% efficency, something that humans could probably never do. These kinds of technologies are still a long way off, however,
  AI is already affecting millions of human lives daily, in both positive and negative ways. Possibly the scariest use of AI we can see in
  society today is its use in surveilience. We currently have AI that can theoretically scan and identify millions of faces in seconds.
  The most famous example of this type of AI is probably the one being deployed in China, scarily named "Sky Net".
</p>

<p>This site is being put together in an attempt to explore AI further, and educate ourselves and eachother on the possible futures
  we may experience. Fingers crossed that we make the right choices when it comes to AI.

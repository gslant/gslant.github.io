<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
	<p>In today’s world, there is a high chance you are being watched. Every step taken, every move made, someone is watching. 
		This is made possible by surveillance cameras. Surveillance is commonly used to monitor various areas of the public every second. 
		Mostly used by government officials, this is used to prevent crime, increase safety, and provide physical security. 
		With this, viewers of the surveillance systems can refer back to specific timeframes of recordings or watch over multiple grounds at once. 
		The impact these electronic eyes made is tremendous, this is because these eyes are watching over every corner. 
		Therefore, it kills the temptation to borrow something you will not return.
                However, with new technology being implemented the modern-day security cameras, it enhances their functions and capabilities to a whole other level. 
		New technology has entered the game and it is being introduced to the current surveillance system. 
		AI (Artificial Intelligence) is intelligence demonstrated by machines that are programmed to think like humans. 
		This technology is shared globally and adopted into their surveillance systems. 
		According to Steven Feldstein,” At least seventy-five of the 176 countries actively use this AI technology for surveillance reasons” (Steve Feldstein, 2019). 
		This means that those seventy-five countries (more or less) have implemented digital brains into their cameras watching over the public.

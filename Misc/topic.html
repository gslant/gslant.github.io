<h1>AI Surveillance</h1>


</ul><h5><p>AI and its use in Surveillance:<p></h5>

<h5><p>What is AI in general?</p></h5>
<p>AI is short for "Artificial Intelligence", and is often used to describe any piece of technology which attempts to
  mimmic a human behaviour in a mildly convincing way. Things such as Apples 'Siri', and Amazons 'Alexa' would fall
  under this definition of AI. However, real AI is technology that raises its own intelligence or ability by "learning"
  over time. Things such as googles "DeepMind", which takes in information and uses that knowledge to improve itself,
  are closer to the true definition of AI. However, even DeepMind still depends on human input, and therefore is not
  technically a true self-learning AI. AI has the power to become thousands of times more intelligence than a human being,
  and can already process data as fast as the hardware its running on can allow, however, it is still struggling with the ability 
  to learn naturally, as a human does.
</p>

<h5><p>How does AI work?</p></h5>
<p>AI is no-where close to how it could theoritically look in the future, however, is does not mean that current AI is 
  not complex. According to Dr. Adams (2019) from UWC, the idea behind AI programming is to replicate the human brain as 
  detailed as possible in a subfield known as "Artificial Neural Networks" or ANN's. Just like a regular computer, the
  AI's "intelligence" is linked to how much processing power it has available, among other things. From here, an AI can 
  be developed to have human sensory abilities, such as voice regocnition, or visual pattern recognition. 
</p>
<br>
<h5><p>What is AI Surveillance?</p></h5>
<pr>Put simply, AI Surveillance is simply when an AI program with visual pattern recognition is fed data via a camera,
    told what data to identify and return, and then let loose to gather information. Alternativly, an AI program could
    programmed to identify patterns in non-visual data, such as medical records, bank details, etc.. and told to identify
    patterns within that data.

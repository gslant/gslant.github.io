<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Based upon the research we conducted, I believe that while there are positive uses for AI in Surveillance,
  such as disease prevention, this technology is mostly used in unethical ways, invading people's physical
  and digital privacy. Governments are using this technology to spy on their own citizens. China uses surveillance
  to monitor the lives of their citizens, the NSA spys on U.S citizens "To stop terrorism", and the Russian FSB used
  analytical search systems to monitor internet traffic. This technology is already being used in an unethical way,
  and while it is good in some cases, as mentioned, the cost of such efficiency far outweighs the benefits.
  The temptation to use such a powerful technology to remain in power is great, and there is nowhere to hide from
  the all seeing eye. "With great power comes great responsibility", only surveillance is already being used irresponsibly.

<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>

<p>Based upon what I have seen during my research, and the examples set by our current-day governments and large companies,
  I believe AI surveillance will majoritively be used in negative ways, such as we are already seeing in China. Large profit-driven
  companies continue to prove to us that their bottom line is far more important to them than any negative effects their product may
  have. It would come as no surprise to me that, in the near future, more governments will hire companies to develop AI similar to
  the one being used in China. In America, for example, this would mean wide-spread 24/7 surveillance of PoC as systematic racial
  discrimination is already one of the countries number-one issues. This has led me to believe that this sort of AI surveillance should
  be highly regulated now, before the technology arrives. Other types of AI surveillance, such as AI used for medical purposes, sound
  completely ethical on paper, however, humans have already found ways to use this technology unethically, and I don't have a lot of faith that other people won't 
  try and do the same thing.

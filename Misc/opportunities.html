<h1>Opportunities for uses of AI in surveillance</h1>


</ul><h4><p>There are many types of surveillance, not all of them bad. AI can massively improve the effectiveness of surveillance systems<p></h4>

<p>One promising use-case for surveillance-AI is in medical imaging. AI can be used to model disease transmission, through a method called 
  syndromic surveillance. Syndromic surveillance is a technique used by medical professionals to gather and monitor statistical data
such as disease markers, hospital case data. (Chen et al. 2009) on effective use of surveillance systems, says "There are circumstances in which automated disease surveillance might
not be effective or necessary. For example, the potential benefit of disease surveillance canâ€™t be realized if
hundreds or thousands of people are infected simultaneously. In another
scenario, disease surveillance would be ineffective in a case that involved only a few people and thus went undetected."
showing that sometimes sydromic surveillance can be ineffective, as "Public-health surveillance is critical
for detecting and controlling epidemics, and the contribution of AI to surveillance has been considerable over
the last decade". 90+% of US public health systems utilize some type of automated data surveillance system.</p>

<p>Another potential for AI to be used well in surveillance is in identifying Terrorist activity </p>

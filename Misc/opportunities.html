<h1>Opportunities for uses of AI in surveillance</h1>


</ul><h4><p>There are many types of surveillance, not all of them bad. AI can massively improve the effectiveness of surveillance systems<p></h4>

<p>One promising use-case for surveillance-AI is in medical imaging. AI can be used to model disease transmission, through a method called 
  syndromic surveillance. Syndromic surveillance is a technique used by medical professionals to gather and monitor statistical data
such as disease markers, hospital case data. (Chen et al. 2009) on effective use of surveillance systems, says<br><br> "There are circumstances in which automated disease surveillance might
not be effective or necessary. For example, the potential benefit of disease surveillance canâ€™t be realized if
hundreds or thousands of people are infected simultaneously. In another
scenario, disease surveillance would be ineffective in a case that involved only a few people and thus went undetected."
showing that sometimes sydromic surveillance can be ineffective, as "Public-health surveillance is critical
for detecting and controlling epidemics, and the contribution of AI to surveillance has been considerable over
the last decade".<br> 90+% of US public health systems utilize some type of automated data surveillance system.</p>

<p>Another potential for AI to be used well in surveillance is in identifying Terrorist activity. Intelligence gathered through datamining
 coupled with the use of AI to scrape data for patterns is a great technique for identifying causal coherence, events that are linked,
 and caused by other events. (Uriarte et al. 2020) says <br><br>"the use
 of Machine Learning techniques was able to visualize and
 predict terrorist attacks. The results section shows that there
 has been a considerable growth in terrorist attacks since 2010
 and that due to the classification models, it was possible to
 determine the probability of which region and type of attack
 may occur."

<p>
The last major use of AI in surveillance is in the financial sector. (Soviany, 2018) says "With current
technological advances and developments in
financial markets, the coverage of AI-based
solutions is expanding to include applications
such as market abuse, market manipulation
prevention and anti-money laundering
(AML)." AI can be used in these situations to prevent threat actors from targeting
Financial systems and institutions for monetary gain. AI is especially useful for this,
as has the capability to sort and analyse huge amounts of data at speeds far faster
than any human could. AI is capable of detecting potential attacks before any human can 
notice them. Investigation of abuse and suspicious activity is very expensive and slow,
as the current systems in place commonly produce false results, requiring human intervention.
Machine learning technology would be an excellent fit for this purpose, as it's constantly improving
nature and high accuracy allow for a reduction in human analysts necessary to keep systems safe.
AI is unbiased, and therefore will be excellent at spotting new types of attacks, as it is not influenced
by previous scenarios

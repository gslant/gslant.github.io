<h1>Potential Choices We Face With AI Technology</h1>


</ul><p>When specifically talking about AI surveillance, there are really only two options to choose between;
  Do we use it to monitor people for the safety of the people, or do we use it to monitor people to further a government agenda?
  I have named these choices "The constructive route" and "The destructive route" respectively.<p>

<h4>The Constructive Route:</h4>
<p>The idea behind the constructive route is to make society a safer, more convenient place to live through the use of AI surveilience.
  The most interesting example of this is the product "Ella", being developed by "IC Realtime". 'Ella' is a program applied to security
  cameras that allows you to "google" for specific events, objects, etc.. that has been captured by the video camera. 
  To put it in IC Realtime's words: <br><br> (Ella | Video Search Engine, 2021) "It can handle 3 video streams @ 2mp or 2 video streams @ 4MP.It's more than just a cloud storage stream box;
  an Ai assisted search engine, or a network load reducer. 
  Ella is an optimized implementation of all three concepts - in one tiny package that makes your video security into the fast, efficient resource it was always meant to be."
  <br><br>
  Ella was created as a safety tool. An example they use to describe Ella's ability is being able to identify a Jeep Wrangler which
  was used as a get-away vehicle after a robbery. - This example is hypothetical, however, it makes it clear that Ella's developers are desinging
  this tool with good intention, as they want Ella to serve society in a constructive way.
  <br>
  IC Realtime arent the only people who believe AI surveillance can help prevent crimes. When explaining the benefits of AI, 
  (Feldstein 2019) said:<br><br>
  "...tracking tools play a vital role in preventing terrorism. They help security forces deter bad acts and resolve problematic cases.
  They give authoritie the ability to monitor critical threats and react accordingly." <br><br> Understanably, Feldstein doesn't go much more in-depth into 
  classified counter-terroism operations, but we can assume that technologies similar to Ella, and facial-recognition are being used to identify and help
  respond to threats. This is, in essence, the ideal use of AI surveilience.
</p>

<h4>The Destructive Route:</h4>
<p>The destructive route is the opposite of the constructive route. This is the path we take when we decide to use AI surveilience against eachother, by breaching
  our privacy and controlling the population. Right now, the biggest example of the destructive route in society is China's use of AI within their cities. Named "Sky Net" (Seperate to the United States' "SKYNET")
  According to PDChina(2018, Mar 27) "'Sky Net', a facial recognition system that can scan China's population of about 1.4 billion people in a second, is being used in 16 major Chinese cities and provinces to help police
  crack down on criminals and improve security". This sounds nice, but China is known to be an authoritarian state, and willing to lie about conditions within the country. China's use of AI is deeply tied to their new 
  "social credit system". The system was described by Wong and Dobson(2019) as:
  <br><br>
  "...the Chinese governmentâ€™s ambitious plan for creating a system for measuring social and civic integrity as well as financial credit scores. It is planned that participation will be mandatory for all Chinese citizens in the year 2020"
  <br><br>
  The system aims to give the Chinese government total control over each citizens life, using 'Sky Net' to identify any "un-patriotic" or otherwise "incorrect" behaviour, and then punish the person accordingly.
  What behaviour counts as incorrect depends on who you are, and what the government already thinks of you. For example, Chinese Uighur Muslims are currently being targeted in China due to a bias against their religious beliefs.
  This means that if you are a known Uighur, shopping in a new store, traveling to a new area, or even trying new food could get you flagged. For your average Chinese citizen, incorrect behaviour usualy means crime, or some form of rule-breaking.
  Sky Net is able to identify any and all of these things, and will automatically flag you. Punishments the government could give you include; Banning you from public transport, throttling your internet speed, limiting your job options, and more.

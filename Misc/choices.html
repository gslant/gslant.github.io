<h1>Potential Choices We Face With AI Technology</h1>


</ul><p>When specifically talking about AI surveilience, there are really only two options to choose between;
  Do we use it to monitor people for the safety of the people, or do we use it to monitor people to further a government agenda?
  I have named these choices "The constructive route" and "The destructive route" respectively.<p>

<h4>The Constructive Route:</h4>
<p>The idea behind the constructive route is to make society a safer, more convenient place to live through the use of AI surveilience.
  The most interesting example of this is the product "Ella", being developed by "IC Realtime". 'Ella' is a program applied to security
  cameras that allows you to "google" for specific events, objects, etc.. that has been captured by the video camera. 
  To put it in IC Realtime's words: <br><br> (Ella | Video Search Engine, 2021) "It can handle 3 video streams @ 2mp or 2 video streams @ 4MP.It's more than just a cloud storage stream box;
  an Ai assisted search engine, or a network load reducer. 
  Ella is an optimized implementation of all three concepts - in one tiny package that makes your video security into the fast, efficient resource it was always meant to be."
  <br><br>
  Ella was created as a safety tool. An example they use to describe Ella's ability is being able to identify a Jeep Wrangler which
  was used as a get-away vehicle after a robbery. - This example is hypothetical, however, it makes it clear that Ella's developers are desinging
  this tool with good intention, as they want Ella to serve society in a constructive way.
  <br>
  IC Realtime arent the only people who believe AI surveilience can help prevent crimes. When explaining the benefits of AI, 
  (Feldstein 2019) said:<br><br>
  "...tracking tools play a vital role in preventing terrorism. They help security forces deter bad acts and resolve problematic cases.
  They give authoritie the ability to monitor critical threats and react accordingly." <br><br> Understanably, Feldstein doesn't go much more in-depth into 
  classified counter-terroism operations, but we can assume that technologies similar to Ella, and facial-recognition are being used to identify and help
  respond to threats. This is, in essence, the ideal use of AI surveilience.

<h4>The Destructive Route:</h4>
